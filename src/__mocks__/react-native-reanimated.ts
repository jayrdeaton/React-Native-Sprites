// Ported from Hangman's src/__mocks__/react-native-reanimated.ts. Fireworks.tsx itself only needs

// Animated.createAnimatedComponent — but this mock is shared (via jest.config.cjs's
// moduleNameMapper) with the sibling GravityWell component, which additionally needs
// useDerivedValue and a SharedValue-shaped useSharedValue return. The rest of the surface below is
// kept intact rather than trimmed to only what's exercised today, since a mock this general is
// meant to serve whatever either component (or a future one) reaches for next, and there's no
// downside to an unused mock export sitting idle.
